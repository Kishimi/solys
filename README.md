# solys
A 2D star system simulation

# How to install
## Linux
### Running it directly
You can try directly running the program in the `bin` folder but I'm expecting it *not* to work.

### Compiling it
* Ubuntu 20.04
   * install **g++** and **libsfml-dev** by running `sudo apt-get install g++ libsfml-dev`
   * run the makefile in the main folder of solys by typing `make` in the terminal
   * run the created executable in `bin`

# Changelog
## V1.0 - Jun 15 2020
* The basics are done!
    * The physiys work
    * You can control the camera
    * You have a "menu"
